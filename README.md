<h2>Getting Started</h2>
First you lay down a html template to be able to target certain phrases on the page. After you can obtain the two
api key and run a ajax call for each one in javascript. After you will need to add a function that will listen for the
click on the page that is attached to the link or button that will redirect the user to the youtube video. Also you
will need to attach the second call(workout manager) so that the description will appear on the page into that function.
